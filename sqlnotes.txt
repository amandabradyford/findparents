#example of ways to shorten the time of sql queries by using subqueries...

select * from parents_ONLY join business4 ON parents_ONLY.BUSINESSID=business4.bid WHERE STATE='AZ' AND Category='Doctors'


SELECT * from parents_ONLY join (select * from business4 WHERE state='AZ' AND Category='Doctors') minisample 
         ON parents_ONLY.BUSINESSID=minisample.bid 


# number of reviews by parents relative to full number of reviews.


SELECT COUNT(*) from parents_ONLY join (select * from business4 WHERE state='AZ') minisample 
         ON parents_ONLY.BUSINESSID=minisample.bid
